# React Router

![React Router Logo](./react-router-logo.png)

Up to this point, our React applications have been limited in size, allowing us
to use basic control flow in our components' render methods to determine what
gets rendered to our users. However, as our React applications grow in size and
scope, we need an easier and more robust way of rendering different components.
Additionally, we will want the ability to set information in the URL parameters
to make it easier for users to identify where they are in the application.

React Router, while not the only, is the most commonly-used routing library for
React. It is relatively straightforward to configure and integrates with the
component architecture nicely (since it's just a collection of components).

We will configure it as the root component in a React application. Then, we'll
tell it to render other components within itself depending on the path in the
URL. This way we don't have to reload the entire page to swap out some data.

## Learning Objectives

- Use React Router's `BrowserRouter`, `Link`, `Route`, `exact` and `useParams`
  components to add navigation to a React application.
- Use URL parameters to navigate to specific pages in React.
- Review the React component lifecycle and use lifecycle methods to integrate
  with API calls.

## You Do: Examine the Coindesk API (5 min / 0:10)

Today we will be building a React app using the [Coindesk API](https://www.coindesk.com/api). Take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the API. Next, we'll see how it fits into our codebase.

## We Do: [React Bitcoin Prices](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-garnet/hooks-react-router) Setup (5 min / 0:15)

Let's get set up with the react bitcoin price checker!

## You Do: Examine Current Codebase (10 min / 0:25)

Since we're starting off with a project that already has some scaffolding built
out, we should spend some time getting our bearings.

Take 10 minutes and read through the code to familiarize yourself with the
codebase with the person sitting next to you. Prepare to discuss your answers the
following questions:

1. What dependencies is the application currently using? Where can I find
   information on them?
2. What is the purpose of `ReactDOM.render()`? What file is this method being
   called in?
3. Where are the components of our application located? Why might we want to
   separate them into their own folders?
4. Where is state located in our application? Is state being passed down to
   other components?
5. Look at the Price component. What props is it expecting to be passed?
6. Where is our application getting data from? How is it accomplishing this?

## We Do: React Router Setup (10 min / 0:35)

Currently, we are rendering just the App component, which renders the Home
component. Let's bring in React Router and set it up to allow us to display
multiple components.

When working with a new library, it's useful to have
[the documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
handy!

### Importing Dependencies

First, we need to install `react-router` and `react-router-dom` as dependencies
in `package.json`. Running `npm install` with arguments should automatically do
this for us.

```sh
npm install react-router react-router-dom
```

To configure our current application to use React Router, we need to modify the
root rendering of our app in `index.js`. We need to import the `Router`
component and place it as the root component of our application. `Router` will,
in turn, render `App` through which all the rest of our components will be
rendered:

```jsx
// index.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";

//...

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

> Note that we are aliasing `BrowserRouter` as `Router` here for brevity.

By making `Router` the root component of our app, it will pass down several
router-specific objects to its child components. Things like current location
and url can be accessed or changed. Additionally, in order to use the other
routing components provided by React Router, a `Router` parent component is
necessary.

Next, in `App.js`, we need to import all of the other components we want to use
from React Router.

The two main ones we're going to use today are:

```jsx
<Route />
<Link />
```

```js
// src/components/App.js

import { Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
```

Now that we have access to these components, we need to modify the `App`
component's `return` to set up navigation. The basic structure we will
use is this:

```jsx
// src/components/App.js

return (
  <div>
    <nav>
    // the link component produces an a element
      <Link to="/home">my link text</Link>
      <Link to="/about">my link text</Link>
    </nav>
    <main>
      // routes render the specified component we pass in
      <Route path="/home">
        <Home />
      </Route>
      // we can give either a render or a component prop, or render the element as a child     
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

> **Link** - a component for setting the URL and providing navigation between
> different components in our app without triggering a page refresh. It takes a
> `to` property, which sets the URL to whatever path is defined within it. Link
> can also be used inside of any component that is connected to a `Route`.

> **Route** - a component that renders a specified component (using either
> `render`, `component` or `children`) based on the current url (`path`) we're at. `path`
> should probably match a `<Link to="">` defined somewhere.

Now let's modify the return in `App.js` to include our Link and Route
components.

```jsx
// src/App.js

return (
  <div>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">
        <img src="https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/2/29/BC_Logo_.png" alt=""/>
        <h1>Bitcoin prices</h1>
      </Link>
    </nav>
    <main>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

Great! But this doesn't do anything because we're already on the homepage.

Also, note that we used `children` in this case to display our home component.
We're doing that because we don't need to pass it any props from our router, and we're
not passing any props in, we're not modifying anything.

## You do: Add a Second Route and Link (10 min / 0:45)

> 5 minute exercise / 5 minute review

Using the above instructions as a guide, add a new Link to `/currencies` and a 
route to match it. What component do you think you want to render?

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

```jsx
// src/App.js
//...
import Currencies from './Currencies'

// ...

return(
  <div>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">
        <img src="https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/2/29/BC_Logo_.png" alt=""/>
        <h1>Bitcoin prices</h1>
      </Link>
      <Link to="/currencies">Currency List</Link>
    </nav>
    <main>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home /> 
      </Route>
      <Route path="/currencies">
        <Currencies />
      </Route>
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

</details>

Now we've got two components and two routes. Perfect. Let's take a look at our
currencies component and see what we need to do to make it work.

This a good point to talk about React Router's
[Route Props](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route/route-props).

## We do: Currencies component (5 min / 0:50)

If we look at this component we see a long list of links. Note that the links
are using regular `<a>` tags.

What happens if we click on a link? It works, but the whole page reloads! Gross.
Let's fix that.

Go ahead and replace the `a` tag with a `<Link>` component. Make the `to` prop
value equal to the `href` value.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import currencies from "./currencies.json"

import { Link } from "react-router-dom"

export default function Currencies() {
  return (
    <div>
      {currencies.map(currency => <h2><Link to={`/price/${currency.currency}`}>{currency.currency}</Link>: {currency.country}</h2>)}
    </div>
  )
}

```

Great! Now go back to the page and click the link again, what happens?

**MAGIC!**

## Parameters

Every time we click on a currency, React Router changes the route for us. Do you notice the URL changing? How are we making these routes dynamic? We are using what we call **parameters**. Route parameters are named sections of our path. Simply put, they are placeholders (similar to variables or parameters) that capture values at their location in a URL.

It changes the route for us (notice the URL changing) but we don't have any
routes set up to match that. Let's do that next.

### We do: Price Component (10 min / 1:05)

Back in `App.js`, we need to add another `<Route>` component. This time though,
we want to include a parameter, which will be signified in the `path` prop with a `:` followed by the name of the parameter.

Look at the URL that we're on after clicking on a currency. Then look at the
`Price` component. How might you write the `path` prop to make it work?

```js
<Route path="/price/:currency">
  <Price />
</Route>
```

## We do: Fix Price component (15 min / 1:20)

We've added a route but not everything will work yet. HOW COME!?

```jsx
<Route path="/price/:currency">
  <Price />
</Route>
//...
```

We can use the [`useParams`](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks/useparams) hook to gain access to the url parameters within our component.

## Using exact (5 min / 1:25)

`exact` works just like the switch/case statements in javascript. We're comparing
string values (in this case, routes) and executing conditions (rendering
components) based on what matches turn out true.

Since we're not using switch right now, we'll see something like this:

![preswitch](./images/pre-switch.png)

There are two components stacked on top of each other! The Home and the
Currencies component. That's silly.

> Why does this happen?

We can handle this by specifying `exact` on routes.

Let's look at our routes in `App.js` again:

```jsx
<Route path="/">
  <Home />
</Route>
<Route path="/currencies">
  <Currencies />
</Route>

<Route path="/price/:currency">
  <Price />
</Route>
```

Try putting `exact` on the `/` path route component.

```js
<Route path="/" exact>
  <Home/>
</Route>
```

> Note: this is equivalent to putting `exact={true}`

Beautiful! this is a great solution, unless we have many different routes.

If we had a list of routes like:

- `/currencies`
- `/currencies/new`
- `/currencies/:id` etc

we would have to put `exact` on `/currencies` or else, any time we went to
`/currencies/something` it would match both the root (`/currencies`) AND the
`/currencies/something` routes and both would be rendered.

So easy!
